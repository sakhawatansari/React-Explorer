# Using Tailwind CSS with React

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build custom designs. It pairs well with React for building modern, responsive web applications. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and use Tailwind CSS in a React project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager
- [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

## Setting Up Tailwind CSS in a React Project

### Step 1: Create a New React Project

If you don't have a React project set up yet, you can create one using Create React App. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-tailwind-app [↩]
cd my-tailwind-app [↩]
```
## Step 2: Install Tailwind CSS
You can install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies via npm or Yarn. Run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```
## Step 3: Initialize Tailwind CSS
After installing Tailwind CSS, initialize it by running:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

## Step 4: Configure Tailwind to Remove Unused Styles
In the tailwind.config.js file, configure the purge option to remove unused styles in production. Add the paths to all of your template files. The purge option should look like this:

```Javascript
// tailwind.config.js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
## Step 5: Import Tailwind CSS in Your Project
```css
/* src/index.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

# Props in React

Props (short for "properties") are a fundamental concept in React that allow components to communicate with each other. They are used to pass data from one component to another, making components more dynamic and reusable.

## What are Props?

- Props are read-only data that are passed from a parent component to a child component.
- They allow you to pass information and functions to components, making them more dynamic.
- Props are immutable, which means that once they are passed to a child component, they should not be modified by the child.

## Passing Props to a Component

To pass props to a component, you use HTML-like syntax. Here's a simple example:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Greeting from './Greeting';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting name="John" />
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
```
